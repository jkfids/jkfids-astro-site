title: "Entanglement teleportation along a regenerating hamster-wheel graph state"
description: "We scheme an efficient and reusable approach to quantum teleportation that allows cyclic teleportation of a two-qubit graph state around a quantum hamster wheel -- a ring of qubits entangled as a one-dimensional line prepared on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processor. The qubits on the ring are periodically measured and reused to achieve a teleportation depth that exceeds the total number of available qubits in the quantum processor. Using the outcomes measured during teleportation, we calculate and apply byproduct operators through dynamic circuits to correct local transformations induced on the teleported state. We evaluate the quality of teleportation by tracing the preserved entanglement and fidelity of the teleported two-qubit graph state from its density matrix. In the real-machine experiments, we demonstrate that 58% of the entanglement of the teleported state is sustained with a measured two-qubit negativity of 0.291Â±0.018 after three complete revolutions around the hamster wheel, or equivalently, after hopping across 56 qubits. By performing teleportation along a regenerating graph state, our work is a step forward in demonstrating the feasibility of measurement-based quantum computation."
